    "In this mini pset, you will implement an incremental path planning technique called D\\* Lite to help a mobile robot navigate through an 8-connected grid world (that is, a grid where each cell has 8 neighbors).  First you'll learn about the data structures used by the algorithm, then you'll implement four helper functions, and finally you'll implement the main D\\* Lite algorithm.\n",

    "In this pset, the robot's knowledge of the world is imperfect. It knows the start node, the goal node, and its current position, but it has incomplete knowledge of the world because it can only see cells that are \"nearby\" (in this pset, we consider \"nearby\" cells to be the 8 neighbors of the cell). Hence, as the robot moves, it learns about the environment and updates its current \"belief state\" of the world. The robot does have memory: it will remember the status of any cells that it used to be in contact with.\n",
